 I created a gym website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
 HTML provided the structure, CSS enhanced the design, and JavaScript added interactivity.
 Bootstrap ensured a responsive and mobile-friendly layout, optimizing the website for different devices.
 The result was a professional gym website that showcased the facility, services, and provided a seamless user experience.
